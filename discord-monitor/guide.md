If there's any news that day, they will be mentioned in a different style of message on the first mention, showing the news and other things like the country flag of the company.
That news could be a press release, an analyst rating or a SEC filing (or multiple types), and it's shown with a similar short-hand key as described in the ⁠📈-gainers  channel. There could also be no news released today, in which case you won't see PR, AR or SEC, and can use the commands to check the most recent news, but there still may not be any. ▶ ATXI

6 - I sometimes see this next to news and scanner pops " ~  1 for 16  R/S  Jan. 04 " - what does it mean?

This is when a company has changed the number of existing shares into either less, with a reverse split (R/S) or more shares, with a forward split (F/S).
These will be mentioned if there has been a relatively recent stock split. It will usually mention the date and the ratio of the split.

I would have a read about share splits on the web to get familiar with what they are but essentially they will either lower the float (reverse split) where if you had more shares, they will be converted to fewer shares, but for a higher price. This affects the float - the available shares to trade held by non-affiliates.

This can be useful to know as occasionally there are themes with reverse split stocks with a lower float getting attention.
It can also affect the accuracy of the reported float, especially when it's more recent as they may have not yet been updated.

7 - I thought we could see the charts when a symbol halts but I don't see where?

There will be a 📊 icon available for 15 minutes following a trading halt. Clicking this button will send you a message in the channel, that won't be visible to anyone else.
It will contain a combined image of the daily chart (on-top) and a 5minute intra-day chart with the vwap line, underneath the daily chart.
After 15 minutes, this button is automatically removed to make it easier to scroll through the previous alerts in the day.
